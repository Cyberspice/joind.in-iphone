 * Refresh button for comments (and others?)
 * Next/previous for filling-in the form fields (maybe just the return button for the username goes to the password field?)
 * Remove the "sign-in" switch
 * Anonymous commenting - API problem
 * Look at all of the layouts
 * Settings screen jumps when kbd disappears
 
 * Tweet about this talk
 * Tweet about this event
 * Location-awareness (which event I'm at, directions etc)
 
 * "Add to calendar" button - No APIs in iPhone to access calendar :(
